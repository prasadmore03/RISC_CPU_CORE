# RISC_CPU_CORE
GYMS-16 is a 16-bit pipelined RISC-V processor built in Verilog with a 5-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB) and Harvard architecture. It supports 13 core instructions. A Python assembler converts assembly to binary. The design is tested with Icarus Verilog &amp; GTKWave, and synthesized using Quartus Prime.
